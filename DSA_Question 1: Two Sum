Question 1: Two Sum

Given an array of integers and a target sum, return indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

Algorithm:

step 1 : start
step 2 : Initialize a hash map to store visited numbers and their indices.
step 3 : For each number in the array:
         Calculate the complement (target - current number).
step 4 : If the complement exists in the map, return the indices.
         Else, store the number and its index in the map.
step 5 : stop


Pseudocode:

function twoSum(arr, target):
    map = empty hash map
    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1:
        complement = target - arr[i]
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[arr[i]] = i


Python Code:

def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
